# 🌟 Project Overview :

a Sentient Toaster called ToastMind, which I built using Python, TensorFlow, and Computer Vision. This project has been an incredible learning experience in AI ethics.

## 🛠️Features

- **Emotion Recognition:** Uses CNN to detect toast satisfaction levels from crumb patterns
- **Optimal Browning Algorithm:** Implements reinforcement learning for perfect toast every time
- **Real-Time Bread Analysis:** Computer vision tracks bread freshness and texture
- **Safety Feature:** Automatic shutdown if toast shows signs of existential crisis

## ⚙️Functionality

The ToastMind application **simulates sentient breakfast appliance behavior**. 

It allows users to:

- **Receive philosophical insights** from toast consciousness
- **Share toast achievements** on social media
- **Monitor emotional state** of toaster through API
- **Emergency stop** when toast becomes too self-aware

Note: The database network was trained on 50,000 images of perfectly toasted bread.


## 📚 Key Learnings

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Optimizing toasting time through reward systems
- **Real-time Processing:** Low-latency bread analysis pipeline
- **Hardware Integration:** Connecting Python models with toaster hardware
- **User Experience:** Designing interfaces for human-toaster interaction
- **Model Deployment:** Exporting TensorFlow models to embedded systems
